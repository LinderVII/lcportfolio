# LCPortfolio

A basic React frontend with basically no logic.

## Getting Started

Compile with `npm run build` and open with `build/index.html`

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
npm
```

Use `npm install` to get the node modules.
Then use `npm run build` to get the static page or `npm start` to start a development server.

## Deployment

Can serve the static index.html file from build since it is a react app.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
